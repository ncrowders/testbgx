  # if you assign tags or categories to a post, they will be

  # tags: ["predator", "evolution"]
  # categories: ["biology"]

  # You can also assign one or more aggregators to a post.
  # For example, in YAML front matter you could have the line:
  # aggregators: ["code-hostel"]
  # This isn't shown to the reader, but the groupin still exists.
  # Thus you have an RSS feed for code-hostel with a URL like this:
  # https://yoursite.com/aggregators/code-hostel/index.xml
